# Stockopedia Coding Test

### Considerations for improvement:

- Provide interceptors for both caching requests and error handling
- Implement NGRX for state management, implementing error handler effect to handle HTTP errors caught by the error handler interceptor
- Complete CSS task addiing conditional NgClasses to DOM elements and displaying of the success/error banners. Not enough time to complete this task.
- Lazy loading, I didn't see the benefit for the test application, but implementing caching and lazy loading in a larger application will improve the performance of the application considerably.

### Application Summary:

- All engineering aspects have been completed. 
- All logic has been unit tested with Angulars built in Jasmine/Karam framework. 
- Components have been split into parent children to improve coding standards and readability with a focus on SOLID principles.
